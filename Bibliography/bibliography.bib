Abstract = {The basics of cell culture as applied to human cells are discussed. Biosafety when working with human tissue, which is often pathogenic, is important. The requirements for a tissue culture laboratory are described, particularly the range of equipment needed to carry out cell isolation, purification, and culture. Steps must be taken to maintain aseptic conditions to prevent contamination of cultures with micro-organisms. Basic cell-handling techniques are discussed, including choice of media, primary culture, and cryopreservation of cells so they can be stored for future use. Common assays which are used to determine cell viability and activity are considered.},

Abstract = {T cell migration across vascular endothelium is essential for T cell responses, as through the expression of specific tissue-homing receptors, these cells then access peripheral tissues, with the goal of eliminating invading pathogens and/or tumor cells. However, aberrant trafficking of T cells to peripheral tissues contributes to the development of most chronic inflammatory diseases. Very little is known about the mechanisms by which T cell trafficking is regulated during inflammation, and it is thus difficult to target this aspect of pathology for the development of new therapies. It is therefore important to understand the pathways involved in regulating the recruitment of immune cells.},

Abstract = {3D cell culture is an invaluable tool in developmental, cell, and cancer biology. By mimicking crucial features of in vivo environment, including cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions, 3D cell culture enables proper structural architecture and differentiated function of normal tissues or tumors in vitro. Thereby 3D cell culture realistically models in vivo tissue conditions and processes, and provides in vivo like responses. Since its early days in the 1970s, 3D cell culture has revealed important insights into mechanisms of tissue homeostasis and cancer, and accelerated translational research in cancer biology and tissue engineering.},

Abstract = {The measurement of cell viability plays a fundamental role in all forms of cell culture. Sometimes it is the main purpose of the experiment, such as in toxicity assays. Alternatively, cell viability can be used to ­correlate cell behaviour to cell number, providing a more accurate picture of, for example, anabolic ­activity. There are wide arrays of cell viability methods which range from the most routine trypan blue dye exclusion assay to highly complex analysis of individual cells, such as using RAMAN microscopy. The cost, speed, and complexity of equipment required will all play a role in determining the assay used. This chapter aims to provide an overview of many of the assays available today.},

Abstract = {The survival, proliferation, and differentiation of cells in culture are determined not only by their intrinsic potential but also by cues provided by the permissive or restrictive microenvironment in which they reside. The robustness and reproducibility of cell culture assays and endpoints relies on the stability of that microenvironment and vigilant attention to the control of variables that affect cell behavior during culture. These often underappreciated variables include, but are not limited to, medium pH and buffering, osmolarity, composition of the gas phase, the timing and periodicity of refeeding and subculture, and the impact of fluctuations in temperature and gas phase composition on frequent opening and closing of incubator doors. This chapter briefly describes the impact of these and other variables on the behavior of cultured cells.},
